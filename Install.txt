Approach A (automatic approach):
1. Run sync.bat -> enough to do just once, this file syncs node modules
2. Run start.bat -> this builds & starts the app on localhost:3000

Approach B (manual approach if automatic doesn't work):
1. Go to src\backend\maps-api & run "npm install"
2. Go to src\frontend\maps-ui & run "npm install"
	-Note: you only need to do steps 1 & 2 once; sync.bat does exactly this
3. Go to src\frontend\maps-ui & run "npm run-script build"
	-Note: you can also do this only once, unless you change source code of frontend app
4. Go to src\backend\maps-api & run "npm start"
	-Note: this starts the server on localhost:3000

Approach C:
1. Call me to check what's wrong
	-Note: I've tested approach A & B on new cloned projects, they should work.

Usage:
- Backend & frontend apps are connected. This means that frontend app can be accessed through backend.
- If you open your browser and go to localhost:3000, frontend app will be sent.
- Backend api base url is localhost:3000/api/ (this is where the frontend app sends requests).
- You can check routes.ts file for more information.
